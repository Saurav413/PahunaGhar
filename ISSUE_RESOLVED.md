# Issue Resolved: Forgot Password Blank Page

## Problem Identified
The forgot password page was showing a blank page due to a **PHP syntax error**.

## Root Cause
The error was in `forgot_password.php` at line 39:
```
PHP Parse error: syntax error, unexpected token "use"
```

## What Was Wrong
The `use` statements for PHPMailer were placed inside an `if` block:
```php
if ($email_config_exists && file_exists('PHPMailer-6.10.0/src/PHPMailer.php')) {
    require 'PHPMailer-6.10.0/src/PHPMailer.php';
    require 'PHPMailer-6.10.0/src/SMTP.php';
    require 'PHPMailer-6.10.0/src/Exception.php';
    use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\PHPMailer;  // ❌ This was the problem
    use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\Exception;  // ❌ This was the problem
}
```

## The Fix
Replaced the `use` statements with fully qualified class names:
```php
if ($email_config_exists && file_exists('PHPMailer-6.10.0/src/PHPMailer.php')) {
    require 'PHPMailer-6.10.0/src/PHPMailer.php';
    require 'PHPMailer-6.10.0/src/SMTP.php';
    require 'PHPMailer-6.10.0/src/Exception.php';
    
    // Use PHPMailer classes with full namespace
    $mail = new \PHPMailer\PHPMailer\PHPMailer(true);
    // ...
    } catch (\PHPMailer\PHPMailer\Exception $e) {
```

## Why This Happened
- `use` statements must be at the top level of a file, not inside conditional blocks
- PHP couldn't parse the file due to this syntax error
- This caused a fatal error that resulted in a blank page

## Current Status
✅ **FIXED** - The forgot password page now loads correctly

## Test Results
- ✅ `forgot_password.php` - Now loads without errors
- ✅ `minimal_forgot.php` - Works as expected
- ✅ `simple_forgot_password.php` - Works as expected
- ✅ `test_basic.php` - PHP functionality confirmed
- ✅ No new errors in PHP error log

## How to Test
1. Go to `http://localhost/PahunaGhar-main/login.php`
2. Click "Forgot Password?"
3. The page should now load with a form
4. Enter an email address and submit
5. You should see either a success message or a reset link

## Files Modified
- `forgot_password.php` - Fixed PHP syntax error

## Lessons Learned
1. Always check PHP error logs when pages are blank
2. `use` statements must be at file level, not inside conditional blocks
3. Use fully qualified class names when classes are loaded conditionally
4. Test with simple files first to isolate issues

The forgot password functionality should now work correctly!
